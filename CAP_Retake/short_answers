From the motions of the particles in the disk, we can see that the disk of Titan gets dispersed very significantly. This is probably due to the huge gravitational force of Saturn. On the other hand, Titan's orbit also gets affected by the debris disk. It's revolution around Saturn becomes unstable and starts to drift with time. Based on the evolution of the system, no mass can be firmed inside the circum-lunar disk, as all debris particles get ejected by gravity. After the debris escaping the disk, their trajectories seem to float within the solar orbit. The sun's gravity starts pulling the debris. The running time of this code is highly dependent on the number of debris, the time step, and the end time. 1000 debris and more than 10 years of end time are taking too long to run any simulations. The evolving time is set to be 1 yr, which is nearly 1/30 of Saturn's orbital period. It's very difficult to see directly the portions of debris end up around the sun. A prediction would be that nearly all debris will leave Saturn's orbit in the end, and a great number of them will run into the solar orbit. This can also be deducted from the energy plot. The energy is conserved during the simulation. Disk and bridge energy are enormously higher than the planetary system energy. Zooming in or plotting just the planet energy will show that it goes down first and then back up, proving that debris disk escaped from Saturn-Titan system. 

I could not get density, semi-major axis, and eccentricity. In the textbook exam it’s clearly that the planet and disk attributes contain the three parameters mentioned. However, write_set_to_file with correct attributes name still won’t produce them. Uncomment ‘test’ and ‘print test’ in ‘make_initial_conditions’ shows that there are only ‘mass’, ‘u’, ‘vx’, ‘vy’, ’vz’, ’x’, ‘y’, ‘z’ produced, making it unable to proceed.
